The withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day on which the Consumer (or a third party indicated by the Consumer other than the carrier) acquires physical possession of the ordered Product. In the event that several Products of the same order are delivered separately, the withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day on which the Consumer (or a third party indicated by the Consumer other than the carrier) acquires physical possession of the last ordered Product.</p>
            <p>7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To exercise the right of withdrawal, the Consumer must inform ETQ of his decision to withdraw from the Agreement by requesting a Return Merchandise Authorisation on the ETQ Website or sending an email with an unequivocal written statement to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.etq-amsterdam.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5a6b0b6b1aaa8a0b7b6a0b7b3aca6a085a0b1b4e8a4a8b6b1a0b7a1a4a8eba6aaa8">customerservice@etq-amsterdam.com</a>&nbsp;within the withdrawal period.

            <p>7.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the withdrawal period, the Consumer shall handle and inspect the Product and the packaging with care, in the same manner as the Consumer would be allowed to do in a retail shop. The Consumer shall only unpack or use the Product to the extent necessary to establish the nature, the characteristics and the functioning of the Product. The Consumer shall be liable for any diminished value of the Product resulting from the handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and functioning of the Product.</p>
            <p>7.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Consumer exercises its right of withdrawal, the Consumer will return the Product to ETQ at its own risk and expense, without undue delay and in any event no later than 14 calendar days from the day on which the Consumer communicated his decision to withdraw to ETQ. This deadline is met if the Consumer sends back the Product before the withdrawal period of 14 calendar days has expired. If the Consumer is located outside the European Union, the Consumer shall declare the returned Product as “Returns and Repairs of Dutch Merchandise” on the customs declaration.</p>
            <p>7.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer shall return the Product with all delivered accessories and in the complete and original state and, to the extent possible, in its original packaging. The risk and the burden of proof for the correct and timely exercise of the right of withdrawal lies with the Consumer.</p>
            <p>7.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Consumer timely exercises its right of withdrawal, ETQ will reimburse the relevant payments received from the Consumer, including the costs of delivery, without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 calendar days from the day on which ETQ is informed of the Consumer’s decision to withdraw from the Agreement. ETQ may withhold the reimbursement until ETQ has received the Product back, or until the Consumer has supplied adequate evidence of timely having sent back the Product, whichever is earliest. ETQ will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as the Consumer used for the initial transaction, unless the Consumer has expressly agreed otherwise.</p>
            <p>7.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding paragraph 7.6 above, ETQ will not reimburse the delivery costs if the Consumer opted for a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery.</p>
            <p>7.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETQ is entitled to refuse to accept a returned Product and the reimbursement of payments if the Consumer does not comply with the instructions of this clause 7.</p>

            <p>8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETQ does not accept any other method of payment than the payment methods indicated on the ETQ Website. ETQ may change these payment methods at any time. All actual costs of payment will be passed on to the Consumer.</p>
            <p>8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consumer has the duty to inform ETQ of any inaccuracies in payment data provided or stated.</p>
            <h5>9. Shipping and delivery</h5>
            <p>9.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ordered Product will be shipped to the Consumer within 1-3 Business Days after the confirmation of the order. In the event that multiple orders with the same shipping address are placed by the Consumer, these orders may be combined, unless otherwise requested by the Consumer. In such event the Products will be shipped to the Consumer within 1-3 Business Days after the last order.</p>
            <p>9.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shipping and delivery terms indicated in these General Terms and Conditions, on the ETQ Website or otherwise communicated by ETQ are indicative and not guaranteed.

            <p>9.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETQ is authorised to engage third parties in the fulfilment of its shipping and delivery obligations under the Agreement. All shipping services used by ETQ provide a tracking number.</p>
            <p>9.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ETQ retains the full and unconditional ownership of the ordered Product until the Product as well as all other claims of ETQ vis-à-vis the Consumer are paid in full (within the meaning of article 3:92 and 7:9 DCC). The Consumer shall in no event have a right of retention with regard to the Product. ETQ is entitled to repossess the Product if the Consumer fails to fulfil any of its obligations under the Agreement and/or if ETQ infers from the Consumer’s behaviour or communication that the Consumer will fail to fulfil any of its obligations under the Agreement.</p>
            <p>9.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All risks in connection with the Product shall pass to the Consumer when the Product is delivered at the shipping address specified in the order of the Consumer.

            <p>10.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complaints submitted to ETQ will be replied within a period of five (5) Business Days, from the date of receipt of the complaint.
